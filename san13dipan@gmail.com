👨🏻‍💻 HOW TO BECOME A RED TEAM OPERATOR 👨🏻‍💻

🔴 BECOME A REAL HACKER 🔴

🔗Link: https://pentestingguide.com/how-to-become-a-red-team-operator/

Thank You!

You want to break into cybersecurity?

DO's:
1. Learn more and demonstrate the desire to learn as well as develop your skillset toward the position(s) you are applying to.
2. Talk about what you're studying/learning on LinkedIn.
3. Join a security group and/or discord - info-sec.live, cyber insecurity, etc.
4. Reach out to people on LinkedIn who work at a position/company you want to work at and ask for their advice on how they achieved that.
5. Think about getting a certain certification like Security+ if you're noticing that every position you are applying for wants that certification.
6. If a position requires x years of experience, it says entry-level, and you meet the other basic requirements apply anyways! Let HR decide your fit. The worst they can say is no!

DONT's
1. Complain about how the system is broken and how you cannot get a job - recruiters see these posts and move on to other candidates.
2. Complain about the ATS.
3. Complaining in general on LinkedIn - nobody wants to hire someone who is openly negative so keep your posts and correspondence positive.
4. Apply for every security position you can find - focus on one or two positions in particular (that are related) and build your skillset around what those positions are requiring.

🔰 7 MOST POPULAR (WiFi) WIRELESS HACKING TOOLS 🔰

🌀 More Post coming soon stay tuned .


1️⃣ AIRCRACK-NG

Aircrack-ng uses the best algorithms to recover wireless passwords by capturing packets. Once enough packets have been gathered, it tries to recover the password.

2️⃣ WIFITE

Wifite is a Python script designed to simplify wireless security auditing. It runs existing wireless h4cking tools for you, eliminating the need to memorize and correctly use the different tools with their various options.

3️⃣ KISMET

Kismet is supported on all operating systems (using WSL on Windows) and is actively supported. It passively collects packets being broadcast in its vicinity and analyzes them to detect even hidden Wi-Fi networks.

4️⃣ WIFIPHISHER

Wifiphisher is a tool designed to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by exploiting Wi-Fi association. It also enables an attacker to launch web phishing attacks. These can be used to collect user credentials for third-party sites or Wi-Fi network credentials.

5️⃣ inSSIDer

inSSIDer is a popular Wi-Fi scanner for Microsoft Windows and OS X operating systems. The inSSIDer wi-fi scanner can do various tasks, including finding open Wi-Fi access points, tracking signal strength and saving logs with GPS records.

6️⃣ WIRESHARK

It runs on Windows, Linux, OS X, Solaris, FreeBSD and others. In wireshark, you can capture packets live and inspect them at a high level or see the values of particular fields within a packet.

7️⃣ KALI LINUX NET HUNTER

The tools discussed so far have been focused on wireless h4cking from the desktop. It is a fully open-source Android penetration platform that is designed to run on Nexus phones.

👉 WHY PYTHON IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST LANGUAGE ?

❇️ Python is an interpreted high-level programming language, which is rapidly growing nowadays.

❇️ It has only fewer steps when compared to Java and C.

❇️ It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum.

👉 NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF PYTHON

▶️ Python is the most broadly applied by developers.

▶️ Python language is easy to read and easy to learn.

▶️ It is easier to write a program in Python than in C or C++.

▶️ This language has wide applicability and is extensively used by scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.

▶️ Python has some unique characteristics that are valuable for programmers because they make coding easier.

👉 WHY PYTHON IS BETTER ?


1)  EASY TO LEARN AND USE

Python language is incredibly easy to use and learn for beginners. Due to its ease of learning and usage, python codes can be easily written than other programming languages.

2) WIDELY USED IN ACADEMICS

Due to its countless use in different fields like Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Data Science, etc.  python language is now being treated as the core programming language in schools and colleges

3)  VERSATILITY, EFFICIENCY AND SPEED

The python language is efficient, reliable, and much faster than most modern languages. Python language can be used in many varieties of environments such as mobile applications, desktop applications, web development, hardware programming, and many more.

4)  LARGE NUMBER OF PYTHON LIBRARIES

The language includes a large library with memory management which is another one of the advantages of Python programming.

5)  THE FLEXIBILITY OF PYTHON LANGUAGE

The person who is an expert in python language is not just limited to building similar kinds of things but can also try to make something different because of the flexibility of the language.

6)  FIRST CHOICE OF MANY PROGRAMMERS

Many Students and developers always look forward to learning the Python language first because of its high demand in the field and the market.
